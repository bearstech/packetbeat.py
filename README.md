Packetbeat
----------

Your packetbeat agents have to use redis channel output

    ```YAML
    protocols:
      http:
        ports: [9200]
        send_request: true
        send_response: true
        include_body_for: ["application/json", "text/plain"]

    output:
      redis:
        enabled: true
        # Set the host and port where to find Redis.
        host: my_redis_broker
        port: 6379
        save_topology: true
        db: 0
        # Choose a name to avoid mess
        index: "packetbeat/sponge-bob"
        # Use pubsub communication
        datatype: channel
    ```
