PacketBeat client
=================

Packetbeat steal packets and rebuild protocol for later analysis. It's called DPI.
The main target is Logstash-Elasticsearch-Kibana, but you can refine events and analyzing them.

Packetbeat.py is a client for packetbeat events.

Packetbeat
----------

Your packetbeat agent has to use redis channel output.
In this example, the target is Elasticsearch exchanges.

```YAML
protocols:
    http:
    ports: [9200]
    send_request: true
    send_response: true
    include_body_for: ["application/json", "text/plain"]

output:
    redis:
    enabled: true
    # Set the host and port where to find Redis.
    host: my_redis_broker
    port: 6379
    save_topology: true
    db: 0
    # Choose a name to avoid mess
    index: "packetbeat/sponge-bob"
    # Use pubsub communication
    datatype: channel
```
